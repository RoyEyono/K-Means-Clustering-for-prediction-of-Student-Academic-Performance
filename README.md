# K-Means-Clustering-for-prediction-of-Student-Academic-Performance
Inspired by Oyelade,Oladipupo and Obagbuwa's paper on the application of the k-Means Clustering algorithm for the prediction of Studentsâ€™ Academic Performance, I decided to create a practical application of their paper on Java.

I approached the problem from a Software Engineering point of view and reused code previously written by unidentified coding enthusiasts. These enthusiasts had written the implementation of the K-Means Clustering Algorithm, regardless of a few bugs in the code, it worked like a charm. I had to, however tailor it to solve the problem at hand. Due to the lack of data, I had to generate random data in compensation. 

Basically, I setup a theoretical classroom with 100 students, with the marks coming in the form of percentiles. Each students takes a total of 5 subjects/modules, it is now up to the algorithm to classify these students into five groups, namely:
